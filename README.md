🦊 Animal Crossing Alert System for Crop Protection
🌾 Overview
The Animal Crossing Alert System is an AI-powered solution designed to detect the presence of animals near agricultural fields and issue real-time alerts to prevent crop damage. This system helps farmers safeguard their produce from stray and wild animals using modern technologies like computer vision, motion detection, and intelligent alerting.

🎯 Problem Statement
Crop damage due to stray animals (e.g., cows, pigs, deer, monkeys) leads to massive losses for farmers every year. Traditional methods like fencing and scarecrows are ineffective or costly. A smart, real-time solution is needed to detect animal intrusions and prevent crop loss proactively.

🧠 Key Features
🔍 Animal Detection using YOLO/Object Detection models.

🎥 Live Camera Feed Monitoring for real-time detection.

📢 Instant Alert System via buzzer.
